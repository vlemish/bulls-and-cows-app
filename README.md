<h2>Bulls and cows</h2>
<div>
<p>As wikipedia says: Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls) is an old code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the commercially marketed board game Mastermind.</p>
<p>It is a game that may date back a century or more which uses numbers or words. It is played by two opponents.</p>

<h2>Bulls and cows rules</h2>
<div>
<p>The numerical version of the game is usually played with 4 digits, but can also be played with 3 or any other number of digits.</p>
<p>On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. 
If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows". Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secret number: 4271</li>
<li>  Opponent's try: 1234</li>
<li>Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)</li>
</ul>    
<p>The first player to reveal the other's secret number in the fewest guesses wins the game.</p>
